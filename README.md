## Advent Of Code 2015-
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)   

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Solutions are being written in Rust and Python both.

### NOTE: 
The repo is being re-organised to use a [scaffolding template](https://github.com/pratyush3757/aoc-template). Therefore Python solutions do not work at the moment.

### Usage
```sh
# For Rust
# example: cargo run --bin aoc_2015_01
cargo run --bin aoc_<year>_<day number>

# For Python
# example: python3 "solutions/python/2015/day_01/main.py"
python3 "solutions/python/<year>/day_<day number>/main.py"
```

### TODO:
- [x] Add examples as test cases
- [ ] Change unwraps to Options/Results and `?` shorthand
- [ ] Add challenge text for each day
